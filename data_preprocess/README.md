# Project description  
This project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. We’ll need to find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children have an impact   
on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness.  
This report will be considered when building a credit score for a potential customer. A credit score is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower   
to repay their loan.  
#### Steps for completing the project  
#### Step 1. Open the data file :credit_scoring_eng.csv and have a look at the general information.  
#### Step 2. Preprocess the data:  
Identify and fill in missing values   
Replace the real number data type with the integer type  
Delete duplicate data    
Categorize the data  
Explain:  
Which missing values are identified  
Possible reasons these missing values were present  
Which method  used to fill in missing values  
Which method used to find and delete duplicate data and why  
Possible reasons why duplicate data was present  
Which method used to change the data type and why  
Which dictionaries selected for this dataset and why  
#### Step 3. Questions:  
Is there a connection between having kids and repaying a loan on time?   
Is there a connection between marital status and repaying a loan on time?  
Is there a connection between income level and repaying a loan on time?  
How do different loan purposes affect on-time loan repayment?  
Interpret your answers. Explain what the results you obtained mean.   
#### Step 4. Write an overall conclusion.
